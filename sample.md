<h6>GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. You can see examples of GitHub Pages sites in the GitHub Pages examples collection.

You can host your site on GitHub's github.io domain or your own custom domain. For more information, see "Using a custom domain with GitHub Pages."

If your project site is published from a private or internal repository owned by an organization using GitHub Enterprise Cloud, you can manage access control for the site. For more information, see "Changing the visibility of your GitHub Pages site."

To get started, see "Creating a GitHub Pages site."

Organization owners can disable the publication of GitHub Pages sites from the organization's repositories. For more information, see "Managing the publication of GitHub Pages sites for your organization."</h6>
